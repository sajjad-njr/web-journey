    Headings Are Important
Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on. -->

    <!-- A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text. -->

    <!-- HTML Horizontal Rules
    The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
    
    The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page: -->

    <!-- Solution - The HTML <pre> Element
        The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
        
        The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
 Tag	Description
<p>	Defines a paragraph
<hr>	Defines a thematic change in the content
<br>	Inserts a single line break
<pre>	Defines pre-formatted text
